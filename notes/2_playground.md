# Playground

Graphical, interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE.

In development, Apollo Server enables GraphQL Playground on same URL as GraphQL server (e.g. [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)) and automatically serves GUI to web browsers. When `NODE_ENV` is set to production, GraphQL Playground (and introspection) is disabled.
