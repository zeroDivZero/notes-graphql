# INTRO

Open-source API standard (different from REST), from Facebook. Single endpoint responding to declarative queries. Only fetch needed data, more efficient, especially for mobile.

Client, not server, determines what data is fetched. Also easier to maintain because to get different data, just change query from client, no server-side change.
